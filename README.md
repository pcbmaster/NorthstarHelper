# NorthstarHelper
Simple small script to quit Origin client after you quit Titanfall, just like the normal steam copy does.

# Install
Just put the powershell script or [this EXE](https://github.com/pcbmaster/NorthstarHelper/releases/download/stable/NorthstarLaunchAndCleanupOrigin.exe) in your Titanfall 2 folder, run the script instead of the launcher.
